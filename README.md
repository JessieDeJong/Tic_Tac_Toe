# Tick_Tack_Toe
My own version of the Tic-Tac-Toe game 
## Description
I created this game for my portfolio project and to test my Python skills. 

## Features
It's a local two-player game. 
Where you can input which player you are and where you want to play on the board.
After each game round you get the option to quit or continue gaming. 
If you choose to continue, the gameboard gets reset and you can start again.

## How to use
You can set-up the project to your local pc to try it out!
